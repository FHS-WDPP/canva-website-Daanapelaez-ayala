            <p>Filled with jaw-dropping scenery at every turn, Kenai Fjords is easily one of Alaska’s most picturesque national parks. One of its most impressive features is the Harding Icefield, a 714 square-mile (1,850sq km) sheet of ice that's up to a mile (1.6km) thick in places, which feeds more than 30 glaciers. </p>

            <p>Mykineshólmur is the westernmost point of the Faroe Islands. It is an islet connected to Mykines Island by a 40-meter-long footbridge that rises 30 meters above the Atlantic Ocean (the bridge is closed). A historic lighthouse, built in 1909, stands at the end of the islet. This lighthouse guided ships through treacherous waters and served as a weather station, measuring temperatures and wind speeds.</p>

<h>Kenai Fjords National Park encompasses over 600,000 acres outside of the harbor town of Seward and was created in 1980 to protect some of Alaska's most incredible glacially carved landscapes. Snow and ice cover 50 percent of the park, with the vast Harding Icefield stretching over 700 square miles.This massive icefield is the source of about 40 tidewater glaciers that pour down from the mountains to the sea. Over time, these glaciers have carved the park’s distinctive u-shaped valleys that fill with seawater to form stunning fjords.   </h>

<h>  Known for its red torii gate and friendly deer, Miyajima (officially called Itsukushima) is already a noteworthy destination. It’s just a short ferry ride from Hiroshima, and a popular day trip for those traveling in the area. Cherry blossom season adds even more charm, as the sakura cover the mountain in splashes of pink. Head up to the peak of Mt. Misen to enjoy the view, or take a wonder along one of the walking trails.  There are 1,900 cherry blossoms on the island, mainly around Itsukushima Shrine, and the best time to see them is from March to April!</h>

<h>  From Mykineshólmur, there are stunning views of the western and southern parts of the Faroe Islands, including Vágar, Hestur, Koltur, Streymoy, Sandoy, Skúvoy, Stóra Dímun, Lítla Dímun, and Suðuroy. The islet's remote beauty and rich history make it a fascinating, albeit inaccessible, part of the Faroese landscape.In 1970, the lighthouse was fully automated, rendering the lighthouse keeper’s role redundant, and the last residents left the islet around that time. Today, only one house remains on Mykineshólmur.</h>

<h>Fjaðrárgljúfur is little known and is thus far less crowded than other sites in the area, such as Skaftafell nature reserve, and Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. Its beauty and isolation make it a dream location for photographers and hikers alike. The canyon is up to 100 m deep and 2 km long and it is located in southeast Iceland not so far away from the village Kirkjubæjarklaustur. The river Fjaðrá runs through it. Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon was created by progressive erosion by flowing water from glaciers through the rocks over a long period of time, some say 9000 years ago. </h>
